Let's say that there is a function called `getHalf`. 

```haskell
-- it halfs when even number is given 
getHalf x = 
  if even x
  then Just (x `div` 2)
  else Nothing
```

This function does not work if we feed wrapped values, for example, `Just 3`. To solve it, we should use `bind(>>=)` operator.

```haskell
> Just 5 >>= half
Nothing
> Just 10 >>= half
Just 5
```

`Monad` is a typeclass.

```haskell
class Monad m where
  (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
```

And `Maybe` is a `Monad`.

```haskell
instance Monad Maybe where
  Nothing >>= func = Nothing
  Just val >>= func = func val
```

`Maybe` is a `Functor` and also a `Monad`!
