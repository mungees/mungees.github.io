- Stacks can be implemented with either an array or a linked list
- Each stack operation takes O(1): Push, Top, Pop, Empty
- LIFO (Last In First Out) queues

#### **Operations**
- Push(Key): adds key to collection
- Key Top(): returns most recently added key
- Key Pop(): removes and returns most recently added key
- Boolean Empty(): returns a boolean if elements exist or not

#### **Pros and Cons**
- Additional pointer needs to be defined for every pushed element in a linked list
- Space can be wasted if we allocate a very large array in an array

#### **Example**
- Balanced Brackets
