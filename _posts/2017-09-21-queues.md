- Queues can be implemented with either an array or a linked list (with tail pointer)
- Each queue takes O(1): Enqueue, Dequeue, Empty
- FIFO (First In First Out)

#### **Operations**
- Enqueue(Key): adds key to collection
- Key Dequeue(): removes and returns least recently added key
- Boolean Empty(): returns a boolean if elements exist or not
