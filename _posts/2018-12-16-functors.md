The `Maybe` data type looks like this.

```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

## Functors

You can't just apply a normal function like (*5) to `Maybe` data type. This is where `fmap` comes handy. Because `fmap` knows how to apply the function. 

```
> fmap (*5) (Just 1)
Just 5
> fmap (*5) Nothing
Nothing
```

But.. How? Here is the answer! `Functor` is a typeclass. It is any data type that defines how `fmap` applies to it.

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

`Maybe` is a `Functor`! This is the main reason that `fmap` knows how to apply.

```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap f (Just val) = Just (f val)
    fmap f Nothing = Nothing
```

`List` is also a `Functor`!

```haskell
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
```


## Practice

The data type `WhyNot` defined as follows:

```haskell
data WhyNot a = Nah | Sure a
    deriving Show
```

Let's make `WhyNot` into an instance of `Functor` and `Monad`.

```haskell
-- definitions
fmap :: Functor f => (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
(>>=) :: Monad m => m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
return :: Monad m => a -> m a

instance Functor WhyNot where
    fmap _ Nah = Nah
    fmap f (Sure x) = f x

instance Monad WhyNot where
    return Sure

    Nah >>= _ = Nah
    (Sure x) >>= f = f x
```
