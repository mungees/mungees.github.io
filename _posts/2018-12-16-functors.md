The `Maybe` data type looks like this.

```
data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
```

#### Functors

You can't just apply a normal function like (*5) to `Maybe` data type. This is where `fmap` comes handy. Because `fmap` knows how to apply the function. 

```
> fmap (*5) (Just 1)
Just 5
> fmap (*5) Nothing
Nothing
```

But.. How? Here is the answer! `Functor` is a typeclass. It is any data type that defines how `fmap` applies to it.

```haskell
class Functor f where
  fmap :: (a->b) -> fa -> fb
```

`Maybe` is a `Functor`! This is the main reason that `fmap` knows how to apply.

```haskell
instance Functor Maybe where
    fmap func (Just val) = Just (func val)
    fmap func Nothing = Nothing
```

`List` is also a `Functor`!

```haskell
instance Functor [] where
    fmap = map
```
