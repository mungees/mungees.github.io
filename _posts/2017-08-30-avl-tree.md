The following is definition of AVL Tree according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

> In computer science, an AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. It was the first such data structure to be invented. In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.

## **Big-O Complexity**
*Note: N is the number of nodes in the tree prior to the operation*

Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take O(log N) time in both the average and worst cases because it is self-balancing. The diffrence between heights of left and right sub-trees are not more than one for all nodes.

## **Implementation**

```ruby
class AVLTree
    class Node
        attr_reader :value, :left, :right

        def initialize(value)
            @value = value
            @left  = nil
            @right = nil
        end

        def insert(v)
            case @value <=> v
            when -1 # insert into right subtree
                @right.nil? ? @right = Node.new(v) : @right.insert(v)
            when 1  # insert into left subtree
                @left.nil? ? @left = Node.new(v) : @left.insert(v)
            end
        end
    end

    def initialize(v)
        @root = Node.new(v)
    end

    def insert(v)
        @root.insert(v)
    end

    def is_balanced?(node=@root)
        h_left  = get_height(node.left)
        h_right = get_height(node.right)
        h_diff  = h_left - h_right

        return h_diff.abs > 1 ? false : true
    end

    def get_height(node=@root)
        return 0 if node.nil? # base case

        h_left  = get_height(node.left)
        h_right = get_height(node.right)

        return [h_left, h_right].max + 1
    end
end

# Create an AVL Tree
avl_tree = AVLTree.new(10)
avl_tree.insert(5)
avl_tree.insert(15)

puts avl_tree.get_height   
puts avl_tree.is_balanced? 
puts avl_tree.inspect
```
