As a Rails developer, I did not have a chance to create a Rails API application from the scratch. So I thought it would be great experience to build a simple API app.

Rails version 5 supports API only applications so let's start by creating ```todo-backend``` with a magical argument ```--api```.

```
$ rails _5.1.3_ new todo-backend -T --api
  create  README.md
  create  Rakefile
  create  config.ru
  create  .gitignore
  create  Gemfile
  ...
```

- ```_5.1.3``` specifies the Rails version.
-  ```-T``` skips the default testing framework.
- ```--api``` tells Rails that we want an API application.

Then the Rails API app is created and is little bit different than a regular Rails app. 

#### Gemfile
- Jquery and turbolinks gems are removed

#### application.rb
- config.api_only = true

#### application_controller.rb
- won't check for CSRF protection
- inherits from ```::API```

```ruby
# before
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base end

# after
class ApplicationController < ActionController::API end
```
