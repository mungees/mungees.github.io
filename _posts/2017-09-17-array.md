Array is contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements indexed by contiguous integers.
- Constant-time access to any element.
- Constant time to add/remove at the end.
- Linear time to add/remove at any arbitrary location.

. | Add | Remove
 :---: | :---: | :---:
Beginning | O(n) | O(n)
End | O(1) | O(1)
Middle | O(n) | O(n)

There are diffrent types of arrays.

#### **1. Static Array**
- size of the array is not changable.

#### **2. Dynamically-allocated Array**
- max size of the array should be declared when allocating an array.

#### **3. Dynamic / Resizable Array**
- Unlike static arrays, it can be resized.
- Appending a new element is often constant time, but can take O(n).
- Some space is wasted.

It has the following operations:
- Get(i): returns element at location i
- Set(i, val): sets element i to val
- PushBack(val): adds val to the end
- Remove(i): removes element at location i
- Size(): returns the number of elements

Common Implementation
- C++: vactor
- Java: ArrayList
- Python: list (the only kind of array)

*Note that there are no static arrays in Python. They are all dynamic arrays.*
